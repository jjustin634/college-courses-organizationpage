                                using big-O notation, various sorting algorithms, concepts of dynamic programming, and divide-and-conquer algorithms.
                                By the end of the course, students should know to apply the appropriate data structures for a given problem for optimal
                                performance. Students will be able to determine the efficiency of basic algorithms. Students must have a good object-oriented

                                This course teaches students Web application development using common tools and frameworks in the current industry.
                                The course covers various front-end libraries and frameworks such as React and Angular and several back-end frameworks
                                and tools such as Python Flasks, Code Igniter Node, and Java Spring Boot. Students will learn both relational databases
                                and NoSQL databases. Students will build various Web applications using various frameworks throughout the term. Students
                                are assumed to have good knowledge of JavaScript, have a good understanding of backend development and of databases. </td>
